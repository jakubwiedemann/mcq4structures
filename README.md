MCQ4Structures is a tool for structural similarity computation based on molecule tertiary structure representation in torsional angle space. It has been designed to work primarily for RNA structures. Proteins are also handled and their representation is restricted to the backbone angles.

MCQ4Structures is available as a free Java WebStart application. The source code is licensed under BSD.
